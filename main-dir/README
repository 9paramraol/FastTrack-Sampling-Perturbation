#############################          Task 1:               ########################################

The flags and their explainination for them in the constant sampling code is as follows:

######## CASE 1: CONSTANT SAMPLING

Tool : FT2S

1. samplingscheme  
For constant sampling "count" and for adaptive "adaptive". In this case "count"

2. samplingtype
-- 0: for the random number generator startegy mentioned in report 
-- 1: for global level sampling using array
-- 2: for thread local level sampling

3. samplingrate
Takes the sampling rate for the sampling part. Make sure it is integral and between 0-100 for samplingtype = 1 and 2.

eg: for thread local level sampling and sampling rate 20% the command will be

	./TEST -tool=FT2S -samplingtype=count -samplingrate=20 -samplingtype=2 -array=FINE -field=FINE -noTidGC -availableProcessors=4 -benchmark=1 -warmup=0 RRBench

######### CASE 2: ADAPTIVE SAMPLING

1. samplingscheme  
For constant sampling "count" and for adaptive "adaptive". In this case "adaptive"

2. burstlen
number of accesses after which sampling rate for the memory location will be changed

3. minsampling
The minimum sampling rate that must be there for any location keep its value = burstlen*(min sampling rate)

4. decRate
Number of accesess that will be randomly dropped in next burlen accesses. Keep it = (decrement in sampling rate)*burslen for linear case

5. burstLvl
"global" for sampling accesses at global level and "thread" for sampling accesses at local level

6. samplingtype 
-- 0 for linear reduction of sampling rate
-- 1 for exponential reduction sampling rate

So for eg 200 burstlegth ,min 20% sampling rate ,10% decrement rate, global level, linear reduction sampling the command will be 
	
	./TEST -tool=FT2S -samplingtype=adaptive -minsampling=40 -samplingtype=0 -decRate=20 -burstLvl=global -array=FINE -field=FINE -noTidGC -availableProcessors=4 -benchmark=1 -warmup=0 RRBench


***** NOTE: for getting the race simply change tool for FT2->EFT2 and FT2S->ET2S all other flags remain same

For the race pair files to get the race pairs the commnd has to be 

./TEST -tool=EFT2S someflags | grep "#---#" > racepair_file

#############################          Task 2:               ########################################

The flags are:

1. racepair: give path relative to benchmark folder. for eg file is present in avrora and you are executing luindex then the flag will be racepair=../filename

2. maxsleeps: maimum number of sleeps a location can incurr.

3. maxTimeOut: maximum time for one exponentially backoff sleep

4. maxContSleeps: maximum number of continious accesses that will go to sleep starting from the first access

The race pairs for this part must be in line by line format meaning:

A-B
C-D
E-F 

race pairs should be give in the file as
A
B
C
D
E
F

Note: in order to change to remove the dected races remove the commented region of "error" function code in src/tools/ft2SS/FastTrackSSTool.java
